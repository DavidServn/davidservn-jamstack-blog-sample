> Close your eyes,
>
> and tell me what do you see.
>
> I see electrical fire,
>
> and faces,
>
> and they are not kind faces.
>
> Then everything goes quiet,
>
> a pool of darkness appears,
>
> it oozes fragments of past lives,
>
> fractals increase in speed,
>
> shadows race all around,
>
> big flashes of grey light,
>
> and then I open my eyes.
